Project 1: Visualizing Anscombe's Quartet

Completed Tasks 1-5

Task 2: The scatterplot points fill color when hovered over.

Bell's Completed:
	1. Bell 1: Tooltip for Part 2 scatterplot.

	2. Bell 2: A pair of bar charts for Anscombe_I.

	3. Bell 3: I styled the visualization with a neon filter as my inspiration. Holi is the festival of colors and is celebrated during the month of March by playing with bright colors.
	
	4. Bell 4: I attempted to draw best fit line for the scatterplots but the code is not completely correct. Only a partial line can be seen in the plot.

Whistle's Completed:
	1. Whistle 1: I tried to replicate the scatterplot set for part 5 using Tableau. Since yellow points were not clearly visible against a white background, I used neon green which was used for part 2 scatter plot. I replicated the range and labels from my d3 visualizations.
	  The time taken to do the graphs on Tableau was in minutes whereas the d3 plots took plenty of time to learn, code and DEBUG!

	2. Whistle 2: Adding on to bell 2, when the mouse is hovered over a bar chart for x, the corresponding bar for y is highlighted and a tooltip with the x and y values appear.
